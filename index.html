            <div><img src="images/r1.png" alt="Krishna" width="640px" height="674px"></div>
            <p>We&#39;re thrilled to introduce you to kr$na, also known as Krishna Kaul, a New Delhi-based rapper who
                has been making waves in the Indian rap scene for quite some time. With his start in the early 2000s,
                kr$na initially rapped in English and even signed with a label. However, he gained recognition after
                releasing his track “Kaisa Mera Desh” in 2010, which showcased his ability to rap in both Hindi and
                English. His music video “Vijay” for a children&#39;s NGO also helped put him on the map. kr$na&#39;s
                talent was later recognized by Raftaar, and he&#39;s now a member of Raftaar&#39;s record label,
                Kalamkaar.</p>

            <p> kr$na and other talented rappers are currently working together under Raftaar&#39;s label, Kalamkaar.
                kr$na gained further recognition after releasing “Vyanjan,” a track where he raps about each Hindi
                alphabet, showcasing his remarkable Hindi rapping skills. Recently, kr$na engaged in a diss track battle
                with Emiway, starting with his track “Free verse feast (Langer)” in response to Emiway&#39;s “Free verse
                feast (Dawat).” Emiway then responded with “Seedha takeover,” but kr$na came back with “Makeover,” to
                which Emiway has yet to reply.</p>

            <p> Despite starting his rap career in English, kr$na&#39;s impressive flow and command of Hindi and English
                vocabulary have made him stand out in the Indian rap scene. His bars are lethal, and his English rap
                lyrics are some of the best by an Indian rapper. kr$na&#39;s unique style and talent make him one of the
                best Indian rappers to watch out for in 2023.</p>
